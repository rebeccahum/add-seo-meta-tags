### Add SEO Meta Tags

This is a Wordpress Plugin that adds the <em>Description</em> and <em>Keywords</em> XHTML META tags to your site's front page, and to each post, static page and category archive. In addition, custom tags can be added both sote-wide and per-page.

This operation is automatic, but the generated META tags can be fully customized. 

#### Installation:
1. Install by uploading this folder and all contents as-is into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your webserver.
2. Activate the plugin through the plugins menu.
3. Visit the configuration page ( Settings -> SEO Options) to set your SEO options.
